					<h2>Uber</h2>
					<p>Designing a new way to carpool with Uber <br>
					UC San Diego (COGS 127 - Data-driven UX/product design)</p>
					<p><img src="images/uber2.png" class="img-responsive img-rounded"></p>
					<h3>Team Members</h3>
					<P>Xirui He, Weiyi Ma, Eryue Xu</P>
					<h3>Context of our research</h3>
					<p>Transportation Apps help build human connections by providing a convenient and affordable way for people to move and travel. Our team focuses on the interactions between riders. We want to extend a feature of Uber that helps a group of users who frequently participate in joint activities to find the right mode of transportation using Uber. Currently, Uber X allows users to choose between one or two seats and to add a stop before the destination. However, it is inconvenient if one of the two riders is at a different location and is being picked up at a different stop. The second rider is not able to track the ride details. The detailed driver information is only known by communicating with the other rider.<br>
					</p>
					<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
					<p>Students and young employees who use Uber pool want a more affordable and convenient way to commute with friends or co-workers regularly for work and group activities.</p>
					
					<h3>Research Process</h3>
					<h4>Collecting User Insights</h4>
					<p>First, we conducted surveys and interviews to understand the context when users would carpool and to summarize pain points for our target users - group riders. Then, We conducted 6 interviews with survey participants who were willing to share about their experience. We wanted to understand the concerns they have while using the “add stop” feature. We wish to find patterns among participants and summarize them into painpoints that we could take into consideration in the redesign.</p>
					<p>Here is what we summarized from 47 responses in the survey & 6 interviews: 
					<img src="images/data.png" class="img-responsive img-rounded"></p>

					<h4>Pain points</h4>
					<p>Users have no control of what people will they be paired with when taking an Uber pool.<br>
						Users have no control of what time they will be picked up when using “add stop” function.<br>
					<img src="images/daw.png" class="img-responsive img-rounded">
					</p>
					

					<h4>Personas</h4>
					<p>Based on our research, we found that young people are more likely to use Uber pool (Because older people own cars!). Thus, we focused on the 20-30 age group to create our personas. These people are mostly students or recently graduated employees. They frequently involve in school activities, sport activities or social activities. </p>

					<img src="images/sophia.png" class="img-responsive img-rounded">
					<img src="images/helen.png" class="img-responsive img-rounded"></p>

					<h4>Competitive Audit</h4>
					<p>After creating personas for our target population, we found 3 existing transportation apps, including a direct competitor Lyft, and two indirect competitors Waze Carpool and Scoop, that offer similar solutions to our target users’ challenges. We analyzed each app’s strength and weakness for our redesign.<br>
						<img src="images/lyft.png" class="img-responsive img-rounded">
						<img src="images/waze.png" class="img-responsive img-rounded">
						<img src="images/scoop.png" class="img-responsive img-rounded">
						<img src="images/compare.png" class="img-responsive img-rounded">
						After analyzing the unique qualities, as well as strengths and weaknesses of these three apps, we think extending the Uber pool option with users’ choice of who’s going with them will be the most effective solution to our target population. It allows users to take real-time carpool with people they know, and with certificated drivers in a broader region than where Waze and Scoop is available. Our extended Uber pool feature can ensure both user’s safety and cost effectiveness.
						</p>
					
					<h4>User Flows</h4>
					<p><strong>Flow #1</strong>: the first UX flow starts when the user opens Uber’s home page. Same as the existing user flow in Uber, users can first choose the destination and add a stop in between. Inspired by Waze Carpool we added an option to create a group for people who frequently wish to carpool together. When choosing to find a ride for the group, it will send a confirmation to all members in the group, who are allowed to edit their stops, and the trip begins after all members are ready. Our problem statement states that we want to help Uber users commute safely and efficiently with people going the same way, especially for our personas Helen and Sophia, the group function makes it safer and more affordable to share the ride with their teammates or co-workers.<br>
				<br><img src="images/flow1.png" class="img-responsive img-rounded">
					<br><strong>Flow #2</strong>: the second UX flow also starts when users open Uber’s home page. The home page shows a map on the top half of the screen like the existing screen but has three tabs below to set the destination & pick up point, choose a car type, and option to add a rider. If the user choose to add a rider from their contacts, Uber will send a notification to the new rider to confirm the trip. After confirmation from all riders, they can begin the trip. This flow is a better design for our persona Daniel who only need to use the  multi-rider feature occasionally, so Danial can use the "Add a rider" tab to add a friend each time he needs to.</p>

					<h4>Paper Prototype</h4>
					<p>The first set of paper prototype corresponds to the first UX flow. We applied linear selection in this plan, which allows users to <strong>enter information step by step</strong>. In most of the screens, we are using Uber’s current design. For example, the first two screens are almost the identical to the welcome page and the page when the user selects the destination in Uber. The biggest change is that we assigned a name to the second stop, indicating that a new person may be picked up there. After the user invites someone to the ride, the invited person will get a notification with the choice of join or decline. User 2 can then edit the pickup spot and start the ride when ready.</p>
				
					
					<img src="images/paper1.png" class="img-responsive img-rounded">
					
					
					<p>The second prototype corresponds to the second UX flow. We followed Uber’s current design style but changed the operation process. <strong>After each step, the user will return to the home page</strong>. This prototype is a radical pattern rather than a linear process. After completing all information, an invitation will be sent to the person they invite. The invited person can add their pick up point and the ride will begin.

					<h4>User Testing</h4>
					<p><img src="images/usertest.png" class="img-responsive img-rounded"></p>

					<h4>Point of View</h4>
					<p>After conducting three groups of user testing, we generate three following principles that we should follow in our design:<br>
					1. <strong>Minimalism</strong>: unnessary icons and designs really distract the user from what to do. They mislead the users to make a wrong attempt.<br>
					2. <strong>Convention</strong>: Convention has a great power over users. We need to fit our redesign smoothly into the current app, and make it easy to understand. It takes time for users to learn about a new interface and a new function. There is also a greater chance for them to make mistakes.<br>
					3. <strong>User control</strong>:Users are sensitive about whether they have enough control on the page. They want to lead the system rather than being guided by the system. For example, they want to be able to quit the current page if they want. From user testing results, we think it is important to give user 2 more control over setting the pick-up point and quitting the ride if he/she wishes to.<br></p>

					<h4>Next Steps</h4>
					<p>According to the preferences of our users, we decide to choose <strong>prototype B </strong>as a base of our later design. This is because prototype B introduces our redesigned new function more clearly and thoroughly. However, there are still changes we want to make to prototype B based on our point of view.</p>
					<li>We will minimize the noise in our page. </li>
					<li>We will follow the convention of Uber’s original design.</li>
					<li>We will add a notification pop-up enable user 2 to make a decision. </li>

					<br><h3>High Fidelity Prototypes</h3>
					<p>We decided to make our prototype based on the second UX flow while making a few tweaks.<br>
					Our high fidelity prototype starts when users open Uber’s home page. The home page shows a map on the top half of the screen like the existing uber home page but has three tabs below to add riders, choose a car type, and set destination. If the user chooses to add a rider from their contacts, Uber will send a notification to the new rider to confirm the trip and enable them to edit their pick up point. After confirmation from all riders, they can begin the trip. When the driver is picking up user 1, the other can track the ride details on the application, which makes the pick up experience more smoothly. We chose to make high fidelity prototypes for this design because from user testing, users reported that this version of the home screen looks more organized and easy to navigate with our new feature. We keep the screens where users set the destination, and choose a ride type the same as Uber’s current design.<br>
					<img src="images/user1.png" class="img-responsive img-rounded">
					<img src="images/user2.png" class="img-responsive img-rounded">
					<br>
					Alternative plan: we choose to follow Uber’s original flow as an alternative plan. We feel that to make such a huge change of the home page, as what we did in the first prototype, is too bold. Mainly, we redesigned user 1’s home page and separate it into different steps, as what Uber does for now.
					Unlike the first prototype, we make the alternative screens pretty much as close to Uber’s original home page as possible. We want to make minimum visual changes while approaching the best functional innovation: by simply adding a “Pool friends” option in the riding type list. Thus, the user will still choose the destination first, then select the ride type while adding a specific rider to his/her journey. This approach might be more efficient because it clearly divides the task into small steps, and our feature appears at a more appropriate place when choosing the ride type. Users will gain control of the company passenger most easily and naturally.

					<h3>User Testing on High Fidelity Prototypes</h3>
					<p>Basing on user testing, we have concluded several points that we would improve on in the final prototype:</p>
					<li>To clarify and better distinguish user 1 and user 2’s locations on map, we would have their profile photo marked right above their location point.</li>
					<li>On user 2’s set up pick up point screen, we would add the destination below the pick up address for users to understand better.</li>
					<li>Redesign the add rider screen to allow users to add multiple (less than 3) riders at the same time.</li>
					<li>Redesign the screen that appears after the ride starts, and make it more closely align with the current Uber ride detail screen.</li>
					<li>Delete the 1 seat option at Pool friends details page to minimize the confusion about how many persons are added to the trip.</li><br>

					<h3>Before vs. After</h3>
					<p>Based on user testing feedback and advice from our TAs, we made the following changes to finalize the prototype:
						<img src="images/ba1.png" class="img-responsive img-rounded">
						<img src="images/ba2.png" class="img-responsive img-rounded">
						<img src="images/ba3.png" class="img-responsive img-rounded">
						<img src="images/ba4.png" class="img-responsive img-rounded"></p>
					<h4>Our complete set of final prototypes</h4>
					<img src="images/highfi.png" class="img-responsive img-rounded">
					<h3>Reflection</h3>
					<p>In this redesign project, we focused mainly on the human connection and providing a more convenient way for a group of friends to carpool more effectively with our proposed feature "Pool friends". In our research process, I think the most effective part is the second user testing session for the high fidelity prototypes. With our experience for the first user testing session, we learned a lot more user insights with the high fidelity prototypes, which helped us improve and finalize the prototypes.</p>
					<h4>Style Guide</h4>
					<p>For this project, we followed Uber's style guide at <a href="https://brand.uber.com/guide#color-primary-brand-colors">brand.uber.com </a>to complete our design.</p>
					<h4>My Role</h4>
					<p>Most of our work is done collaboratively between the three team members. During the final prototyping, I focused on designing the Pool friends details page and the trip details page.</p>
